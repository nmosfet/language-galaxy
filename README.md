# Atom SCII Galaxy language support

Atom support for Blizzard's StarCraft II Galaxy scripting language. Contains language syntax highlighting and Blizzard native functions and constants highlighting and autocompletion snippets.

Natives were parsed using a python script (gist.github.com/90-proof/d8ec8a2f2cd9402b2ca7). Natives declarations can be found inside MPQ libraries *.SC2Mod/Base.SC2Data in Blizzard StarCraft II Mods folder.
